## The code   
This was our midcourse project at Craft Academy. We used two external API's to create a website where the user can searh for a cocktail and get the ingredients and instructions on how to make it. After that user can see all the options on alcholic beverage from a specific cocktail in System Bolaget store: brand, price, measurment etc.
